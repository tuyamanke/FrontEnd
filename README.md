# hello-world
This is a test for github repository !
But now I need to make some differences to test the branch's function.

So what should I to say?

Ok, actually, I really think coding just should be a interesting hobby rather than a heavy task for every coder.

Now I think what I said is enough, so it should be a pause but not the end beacuse the creativity has no end.
